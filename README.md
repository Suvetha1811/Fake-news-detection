# Fake-news-detection
A  type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread 
through social media and other online media. T
his is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas.
Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims,and may end up being viralized by algorithms,and users may end up in a filter bubble.
This advanced python project of detecting fake news deals with fake and real news.
Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. 
Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model.
In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.
